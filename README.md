# Gemineye Pricing Optimization Analysis

##  Project Overview
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of **pricing optimization for Gemineye**, a luxury jewelry retailer. The goal of this project is to **improve pricing efficiency** by addressing:
- Overpricing that may drive away price-sensitive customers.
- Underpricing that reduces profit margins.
- Difficulty in dynamic price adjustments based on market trends, customer preferences, and competition.

##  Problem Statement
Gemineye currently uses **manual pricing adjustments**, leading to inefficiencies such as:
- Inconsistent pricing strategies across regions and product lines.
- Lack of a data-driven approach to demand elasticity.
- Slow responses to competitive market changes.

##  Objectives
- Implement a **data-driven pricing strategy** using demand elasticity models.
- Improve real-time price optimization based on market trends.
- Reduce manual effort and increase accuracy in pricing decisions.

##  Methodology
1. **Data Collection**  
   - Gather historical sales data, seasonal trends, and competitor pricing.
2. **Price Elasticity Analysis**  
   - Assess how price changes impact sales volume.
3. **Dynamic Pricing Model**  
   - Develop algorithms to automate price adjustments based on demand.
4. **Implementation & Testing**  
   - Simulate pricing strategies before full deployment.
